# Character Input Controller
A simple addon that adds a Character Input Controller node to Godot, which simulates a dual analog controller setup on touch-screen devices.

Features:

- Editor friendly; it also grab mouse events to simulate touch.
- Easy-to-use; this repo has an example of a 3D camera setup for mobile.
- Simple options to tweak; the default "stick" values of the addon are very similar to 3D mobile games.

As of now, it's not possible to use this addon with "Simulate Mouse from Touch" from the Project Settings, as it create problems with the multi-touch input necessary for the controller to work.
